# Rest API with connection to Autonomous Database from SaaS Application

## Objective

In this lab we will create REST APIs using Python Flask that is connected to Autonomous Database. 
It can be used by different SaaS applications. 

## Pre-requisites

- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account with Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service.

- You need to have a connection to database through admin in your SQL Developer. 

    - Open up your SQL Developer and create a new connection for admin. If you already have a connection, skip this step. 

    - Enter the following details for admin:

        1.	Connection Name: GIve any connection name
        2.	Username: admin (or any DB user)
        3.	Password: Password you entered while creating database on cloud.
        4.	Connection Type: Cloud PDB
        5.	Configuration File: Path to your wallet
        6.	Keystore Password: Password entered while downloading wallet.

    - Click on Test, if it shows success, click on save and then click on connect. 
    
- You should have your local environment configured with instant client and the wallet. 
  If it's not, download and follow the instructions in this file. [Configure Instant Client & Wallet](configureIC.docx)

### **Step 1**: Create channels table in Autonomous Database.

- Download the csv file. [channels.csv](Data/channels.csv)

- Upload data from the following csv file in your autonomous database.

    1. Right click on **table** and then **import data**.

    4. Click on next till you reach the review page and click on finish. Table is created and the data is loaded.
    
### **Step 2**: Download and configure the script.

- Download the following script [app.py](app.py)

- Open this script and change the following parameter in the code:

    **username = "Your username"  
    password = "Your password"  
    service_name = "Your service name"**
    
- now run the script as **python app.py**
  

### **Step 3**: Run the application.

- Set environment variable "FLASK_APP" to the path of the app.py
  
  **export FLASK_APP=path to app.py**
  
- Type following command in command line:

  **flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000**

- Now open any web browser and type **"localhost:5000/channels"**

  You will see channels information on the browser. 
  
  You can also deploy this application in a compute instance and can use the REST API in SaaS Applications.
